Gears
===
Generic Educational Autonomous Robotics Simulator

This simulator was created to allow anyone to experiment with robotics without owning a robot.

Try it out at https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg

...or the latest version from github https://quirkycort.github.io/gears/public/

It uses the Ev3dev api (...and some early support for Pybricks), so the code can run on an actual Lego Mindstorm EV3 if you have one.

Installation
---

The simulator is meant to be served through a webserver, and we maintain the site at https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg free for anyone to use.

If you wish to run your own local copy, download all files and put them in a directory on your server and that should be it.
Due to CORS protection on web browsers, it will not work when served from a "file://" URL.

If you do not have a webserver, but have Python3 installed on your computer, you can try changing to the gears directory and running...

`python -m http.server 1337`

This should get the site running on http://localhost:1337 (...try http://127.0.0.1/1337 if that doesn't work).
Do not close the window with the Python command running.
