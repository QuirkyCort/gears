  <title>GearsBot Privacy Policy</title>

<body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>
        This is the privacy policy of the GearsBot website hosted at https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg.
        As GearsBot is a free and opensource software, you may find it hosted on other sites as well.
        This privacy policy does not apply to these other sites, as we have little to no control over them.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        We don't use any cookies.
        If you'll like some, we're partial to Famous Amos.
        Drop by our place and we'll be happy to share.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Logs</h2>

    <p>
        Like any web servers, the web server for GearsBot keeps a log of every request and error.
        Standard stuff.
    </p>

    <p>The log will contains information about...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Which page is being requested</li>
        <li>Time and date of request</li>
        <li>IP address of the requestor, which in turn provides a rough location where the IP address is located</li>
        <li>User agent sent by your browser, which typically contains the browser and operating system name</li>
        <li>Referrer page (...if your browser and the referrer page is configured to send this)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We use this log to monitor the amount of traffic on our server and fix errors.
        We do not use this data to show you content based on a location, so everyone sees the same content regardless of where you are.
        We do not sell this information and doubt anyone would want to buy it.
    </p>

    <p>The server log is purged regularly to save space.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>

    <p>
        The GearsBot website links to some third party websites.
        They may or may not collect your personal information; we don't really know, those sites don't belong to us.
        Read their privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Data</h2>

    <p>If you wish to remove your personal data from our system, please follow these instructions:</p>

        <li>You're done</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We don't collect, keep, or want any of your personal data.

    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>

    <p>
        GearsBot automatically stores your code (Blocks or Python) on your browser.
